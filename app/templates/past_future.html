                    <p>
                    Judging by the title of this post you would not expect my opening statement to have involved the approximately 7.6 billion people living on this planet right
                    now, the title itself is specific to one human being (me) and not 7.6 billion human beings however there is a use to mentioning the entire world population.
                     Taking into mind the world population we can safely assume that there are 7.6 billion individual stories to tell, each one of them unique with maybe a few
                    similarities here and there with other stories but all in all most of these stories are specific to one individual. Life stories, as a result of this, are fascinating, at least to me they are. You're probably assuming that I am about to recount my entire life story. I am not. The purpose of this post is merely for my use in planning the next few years and projects, as I am currently a little demotivated. Hopefully writing this will help cure this demotivation. Of course if reading this is somewhat useful to you then it's a pleasure to help.
                    Without further ado, here goes:

                    <p>
                    Of course my problem with writing these sorts of things is always where to start, what will probably be most useful right now is to start with where and how I am now.
                    As of writing I am a healthy 18 year old male, about to start an undergraduate degree in biochemistry and molecular cell biology. At this point you may wonder why I took such a course, surely something like engineering or computer science would have proved more useful? There are many reasons as to why I chose this specific path in life, I find the subject theory to be incredibly interesting and as biochemistry keeps on expanding so too will it's application in the real world (there are 7.6 individuals in one specific species to investigate and aid using biochemistry after all!)
                    The more "decisive" reason actually consists of what courses I decided to take in college (senior high school for the Americans) two years back. I made the mistake of taking all of the natural science subjects and maths as my A-Levels (those who have studied any A-Level science will know how difficult this really is). Why did I do that? Well, I initially wanted to be a theoretical physicist however I also had an interest in the other sciences so I took all of them, also I thought it looked impressive at the time. The workload was intense and I was specifically struggling with physics, oh the irony, so I dropped physics alongside the dream of being a theoretical physicist. With all that gone I was left looking for a new ambition in life, which quickly became biochemistry after being forced to choose for a summer school (it had a cool name and I promised to read around the subject later on). After reading around the subject I became more intrigued, the questions that people were trying to answer with biochemistry were thought provoking to say the least. For example, how did life come about from lifeless molecules and atoms? Whoa, I mean there is definitely a point to be made here, we are essentially made up of lifeless atoms and ions so how do living organisms manage to display emotion and thought?

                    So the career deciding decision I made a year back was essentially made due to a few errors in judgement, if you were to take anything away from this post it would be that mistakes can actually open new doors in your life so mistakes aren't always bad.
                    
                    Alright so now that my slightly uneventful past with biochemistry is covered I now have to consider the future I want with it, I am taking an undergraduate degree with an integrated masters so I should probably stick with it for a while. The obvious two options in terms of a career with biochemistry are a career in research or a career in industry. Now on one hand a career in industry is more stable, the pay is higher and it is easier to find a job in it. Another benefit would be that I would not have to get a PhD whilst with research I would have to. Of course research has it's pros aswell, most notably the more "fulfilling" job, I would eventually get to research what I want to research (which I find quite cool). 
                    
                    Another career option that I would like to include is teaching biochemistry. I will skim past this one for now however I will come back to this career option later on this post, for now I think I've covered most of the career options I want out of a biochemistry degree.

                    <p>
                    Now that most of the professional aspect of my life is out of the way, there really isn't much to it as of writing, I'd probably want to return to the present again.
                    Alright so again healthy 18 year old, typing away to the sounds of Curtis Mayfield. Music is pretty important to me, as is the case with most people, so I guess I should probably go through the musical aspect of my life as I hope to retain this in future years. I spent most of my childhood living in or near a university campus, said university campus was pretty "cultured" so I was indirectly taught about the current indie acts that were making the rounds at the time. These acts would have include the Kaiser Chiefs, LCD Soundsystem and Hot Chip among others. Of course I was given a more direct introduction to music by my parents, the Beatles/Beach Boys/Queen. 
                    It was a few years later during my early teens that I became interested in music again, first listening to bands like Nirvana and RHCP. I then spread out and started listening to a large variety of different acts turning me into the music nut that I think I am. After some time I started learning how to play guitar and now I'd say I'm semi-decent at playing it, so I could definitely do something productive with music.
                    So what could I possibly do with music in the future. A number of options spring up. Firstly I could start a band, typical for people of my age, or I could start producing music on my laptop, however that would require much more practice and theory which therefore requires time. I could also write album reviews on this site, I like watching analysis videos and reading Pitchfork so I'd probably enjoy writing music reviews.
                    Apart from these options I cannot really do much with music so that wraps up this even shorter section.

                    <p>
                    Once again let's return to the present.
                    So here I am typing away, but why am I even doing this?
                    Aside from the fact that this will help me understand what I want to do why did I spend a considerable amount of my time programming a website for my blog and then proceeding to write this. Surely it isn't just for this post, right?
                    The answer is obviously no. So why make a blog in the first place?
                    It's probably fair to say that most humans like to read, intaking information is just satisfying for a lot of us and I am no different. Any form of writing can be considered art and when I view art I develop a desire to want to learn and execute said art (hence explaining my slight desire to make music). Writing is no exception to this rule and thus I am writing this post now. 
                    
                    And now to think about what future I can build with this skill. Well once my writing starts improving my previously mentioned career as a researcher would improve by tenfold, as the end product of all scientific research is a neat document laying out the findings from the research. Obviously this would only occur if I choose to be a researcher. An improvement in writing would also lead to an improvement in my public speaking, a more general positive. Of course making a blog site that improves over time would be more of a short-term improvement.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    As previously mentioned I did actually program the site so I obviously have some experience with programming.
                    I started learning Python at 14 years old because I wanted to make my own videogame with Pygame. After two years of learning I decided to switch my goal from becoming a videogame developer to just a developer of anything. During the last 2 years I've been learning how to develop web sites and have been helping out smaller open source projects on Github, the most ambitious of them being a command line weather application, which is now defunct. Through helping out these projects I eventually learnt what it takes to be a decent programmer, this being adaptability to new technologies. So at least I understand what I need to be a good programmer however I don't yet have that, this is where I look to the future.
                    Baring in mind that I still need to practice programming so that I can adapt better as a programmer, what projects should I embark on in the next few years?
                    Firstly I have a website so I should probably continue developing it and try to get users for it soon. Secondly I have this blog to maintain. So in terms of web development I'd say I'm keeping the workload up.
                    How about for game development? This is where I'm actually given two options, either to continue developing on Pygame or learn how to use an actual game engine. Considering that the game I want to make is a little more ambitious than the other ones I'd probably want to do the latter.
                    The final thing I have to consider is whether I should try to incorporate programming into my course and future jobs. The answer to that would be yes, if it is possible to do so and does not endanger anyone around me.
                    So that's probably it for the programming side of things.

                    Alright so thats a crash course into my planning process and future prospects and I'm sure you've gathered just how much of a mess my ambitions are.
                    As of writing, quite a few of the projects and long term projects established here are going underway, or about to go underway. I hope for the best with these projects and I also hope I manage to see them through the end, if not then at least I'll learn something from them. But for now I think I've achieved the task of motivating myself again, which is always great.</p>
